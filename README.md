This code is an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, using popular libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` and `missingno`. The goal of EDA is to understand the structure of the data, detect anomalies and gain insights that can be used for further analysis.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- missingno
- google.colab

## Data

The data used in this code is in a CSV format and is loaded using `pandas`. The data represents weather conditions in different locations in Australia, over a period of several years. 

## Code Structure

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and dependencies. Then, it loads the data from a CSV file and performs data cleaning, data transformation and data visualization steps.

The cleaning steps include checking for and filling in missing data, converting data types to the appropriate format, and removing unnecessary columns.

The data transformation steps include creating new columns, such as day and year, and computing descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation and quartiles. 

Finally, the data visualization steps include creating several plots, such as histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps, to explore the relationship between different variables, detect patterns and outliers, and gain insights that can be used for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This code is a basic example of EDA in Python, and can be used as a starting point for more complex analyses. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process, as it provides insights into the underlying structure of the data, helps to identify potential issues with the data, and guides the selection of appropriate statistical methods for further analysis as I tried out using various model building techinques for evaluation.
